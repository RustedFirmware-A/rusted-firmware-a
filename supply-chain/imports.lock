Inspection reveals that the crate in question does not attempt to implement any
cryptographic algorithms on its own.

Note that certification of this does not require an expert on all forms of
cryptography: it's expected for crates we import to be \"good enough\" citizens,
so they'll at least be forthcoming if they try to implement something
cryptographic. When in doubt, please ask an expert."""
