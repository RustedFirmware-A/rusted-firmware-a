Inspection reveals that the crate in question does not attempt to implement any
cryptographic algorithms on its own.

Note that certification of this does not require an expert on all forms of
cryptography: it's expected for crates we import to be \"good enough\" citizens,
so they'll at least be forthcoming if they try to implement something
cryptographic. When in doubt, please ask an expert."""

I grepped for \"crypt\", \"cipher\", \"fs\", \"net\" - there were no hits.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
